//intro to using the Console.WriteLine(""); function. Don't add the quotation marks to the brackets to create a break in the text.

Console.WriteLine("Congratulations! This is your first code!");
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Lalala.");
Console.WriteLine("Congratulations!");
Console.Write("You wrote your first lines of code.");
